## Lab 5
* This includes the things from the first five labs as well. 
* I am not sure if you would like me to resubmit those ones as well. 
* There was a problem with reading the stdin before that should be fixed by this one. I was held up for a bit trying to get the `parse.py` to work properly, but now it should be good.
* Please let me know if you want me to resubmit the others as well.
